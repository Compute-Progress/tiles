# Tiles

## It's really just about tiles

Very simple project. I wanted to see how I could "partition" the screen in order to better detect collisions without having to check every object in the simulation. 

Well there aren't any collisions in this project but what mattered was getting the "algorithm" right...  In truth there isn't much of one. But the concept can be expanded to more ambitious projects.
